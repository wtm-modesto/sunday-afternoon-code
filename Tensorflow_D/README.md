1. Introduction and Setup
    1. Introduction to TensorFlow
        TensorFlow.js is basically an OpenSource WebGL JavaScript library for machine learning.It allows to train neural networks, therefore, also deep learning in your browser. It is based off the regular TensorFlow library built in Python, and borrows all the concepts form its parent library.

        - First, you have tensors, which is the central unit of numerical values where we shape our data into one or many arrays. Tensors are immutable, therefore, the values we assign to a tensor can't be changed. 
        
        - Then you have variables, which are a set of values that you can assign and can be changed. And if you need to set values that will be changed as you train your models, variables are best. 
        
        - Operations, or ops, are functions that allow you to manipulate data stored by tensors or variables.

    3. Introduction to machine learning
        Machine learning is the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
